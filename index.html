 <h2> Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone: Chapter One Summary </h2>
 <h5> September 30, 2022 by Ameka Williams </h5>

 <p> Chapter One of "Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone opens with the introduction of the Dursley's. A seemingly and perfectly normal family who had everything in the order that they liked it. However, they had a rather embarrasing secret, one that they thought would destroy their persona of being normal. You see, Mrs. Petunia Dursley, had a sister caled Lily who was the first and only witch of their family and Petunia was bewildered by. 
     Just as the Dursleys did, Lily and her husband James also had a son who is the center of this fantasy series, Harry Potter who the Dursleys would never come to accept. The Dursleys never did speak about the Potters but while at work Vernon Dursley saw abnormally dressed people who kept whispering about the Potters. He made the grave mistake of mentioning this to his wife who immediately shut it down and all about the Potters was forgotten, or so it seemed.</p>
 <p>The story progresses and we meet Albus Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall who would inadvertently become the bearers of bad news for the Dursleys. Both professors were from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy; a school for young witches and wizards. As the story would have it, Lily and James Potter were killed by a dark wizard Voldemort, who failed to finish Harry off as a baby. They had been expecting someone and he made quite the entrance. Hagrid had just arrived on Privet Drive with Harry bundled and asleep. Professor McGonagall was skeptical of the plan that Dumbledore had which was to leave Harry Potter in the care of his Aunt and Uncle. She had watched them all day and they were the worst sort of muggles to exist. Dumbledore, in his wisdom, insisted that this was the best place for Harry and so he was left upon the door with a letter where he would spend the first 10 years of his life with all this information withheld.</p> 
 <h2> Character Profiles </h2>
 <h5> September 30, 2022 by Ameka Williams </h5>
 <p><img src="HP Character.jpg" alt="HP Character" class = "floatRight">
 <p> Harry Potter: At the age of one, Harry's parents are killed by Lord Voldemort, who then attempts to kill him with the Killing Curse. Due to The Power of Love from his mother's self-sacrifice, however, he survives and rebounds the curse upon Voldemort, getting a lightning bolt-shaped scar as a souvenir. The series' resident Eccentric Mentor, Dumbledore, then arranges to have his Muggle aunt and uncle take him in or else. For ten long years, they grudgingly comply, forcing Harry to live in the cupboard under the stairs and being both cruel and neglectful of him. Harry's bullying cousin, Dudley, doesn't make things any easier.</p>
 <p> Petunia Dursley: Like her husband, Petunia was a nosy, angry, and repressed lady who was maniacally preoccupied with "looking normal." Petunia detested magic and was extremely scared of it, as well as anything unusual.</p>
 <p> Vernon Dursley: Vernon was described as a strong, muscular man with a prominent purple face. He had short neck, vicious tiny eyes that narrowed to slits when he was upset, thick, dark hair, a bushy black moustache (which he twice tore out in a fit of rage). The physical reactions Vernon had to magic or when he tried and/or failed to control his fury were well known. The latter would have a visible vein throbbing in his temple. Additionally, the color of his face would alter to a sickly oatmeal grey, various shades of purple, and red that turned green. In one instance, it was claimed that he had a face that resembled a "giant beetroot with a moustache."</p>
 <p> Lily Potter: Lord Voldemort and other bullies have been confronted by Lily Evans Potter, who is known for her kindness and compassion. Although Lily never loved Severus Snape, they had a close friendship that came to an end when he dubbed her a "mudblood," the most derogatory term in the wizarding community.</p>
 <p> James Ptter: James was a gifted wizard who was also highly mischievous as a child. He was haughty and conceited. He occasionally mistreated and cursed other students for amusement, especially Severus Snape, his longtime foe. But even at this point in his arrogance, he still had some admirable traits.</p>
 <p> Albus Dumbledore: Dumbledore's qualities include wisdom, gentleness, kindness, mystery in his demeanor, knowledge, and compassion. Dumbledore serves as Harry Potter's mentor and guardian, inspiring the boy wizard, his companions, and the reader to follow in his footsteps. They will be more courageous, intelligent, and considerate.</p>
 <p> Minerva McGonagall: Minerva isn't completely without personality; she has a dry sense of humor despite her stringent teaching methods and no-nonsense approach in the classroom (though rarely).</p>
 <p> Hagrid: Since dropping Harry Potter off at Number 4 Privet Drive as a newborn, Hagrid has cared for him. Hagrid is Harry's friend and a caring mentor now that he is a student at Hogwarts, always looking out for Harry's best interests. </p>
